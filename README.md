CI/CD pipeline for a container application

Project Description:

This project creates a cron job in the kubernetes cluster. The container application which developed in python would stop GCP VMs at the sheduled time. The jenkins CICD pipeline job will deploy the cronjob into kubernetes cluster. This is an alternative solution to save your compute cost in the GCP accounts. please refer weblink [1]
